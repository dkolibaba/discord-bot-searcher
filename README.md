#The idea - small utility bot, that will parse messages in the channel one by one, looking for the embeds and attachments, where message content, embed title or attachment filename contains the search string. The result goes back as html table file.

#up. 1 - make an html table from the result object and attach it to the answer

#up. 2 - add message contents and attachments check for the search string

#up. 3 - add module to check permission of the user who executed command + reading them from file

#up. 4 - add controls for regulating permissions from chat + writing them to file
